Budget Buddy State

At any given moment
- the program would have the user's Budget
- it would have a display of the remaining budget
- a list of each budget item
- have the percent of the budget that each category represents

Budget
*Is holder for initial info that user enters.*
- total budget
- remainder of total budget
- percent of total budget that each category represents

Categories
* build a function
that adds up total of current expenses in a given category, assign that total to a
variable and subtract that variable from the initial category total*
- initial Budget *is set by user initially *
- current category total
- *EXTRA - percentage of category total that has been reached
- expense array *updates when expense item is entered*

Expense Items
*User enters expense. Current remaining budget of related category updates*
- category
- amount
- description

*Universal Function- addNewExpense > if entertainment, create new expense class
instance and add to that category array.*
